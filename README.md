# ICE Encounters Safety — Open Reference Repository

This repository is a transparent, open-source reference that organizations can inspect, copy, and adapt to build their own immigration rights, safety, or rapid-response tools. It is designed for replication and auditing, not ownership—showing *how* the system works so others can responsibly create their own versions.

---

## Purpose

This repo exists to make **process, structure, and safeguards visible**.

Rather than shipping a closed product, it documents:
- How safety-oriented, rights-focused systems can be designed
- How information is constrained, framed, and delivered responsibly
- How to reduce harm, misinformation, and escalation during high-risk situations

Everything here is meant to be forked, adapted, or used as a reference.

## What This Repository Contains

- **System prompts & interaction logic**  
  Reference prompts and flows used to guide high-risk, rights-based interactions.

- **Know Your Rights (KYR) materials**  
  Curated, vetted educational resources for immigration encounters, warrants, detention, workplaces, and protests.

- **Design constraints & guardrails**  
  Explicit limitations on what the system can and cannot do, and why.

- **Documentation for adaptation**  
  Notes explaining how organizations can localize, modify, or extend the system.

---

## What This Repository Is Not

- Legal advice  
- A substitute for attorneys or trained advocates  
- A deployment-ready product  
- A centralized authority or platform  

This is a **reference implementation**, not a service.

---

## Who This Is For

- Community organizations and rapid-response networks  
- Legal aid and rights-education groups  
- Developers building civic or safety-oriented tools  
- Researchers and auditors evaluating AI governance and restraint  
- Journalists or policymakers examining system design choices  

---

## How to Use This Repo

- **Fork it** and adapt it to your jurisdiction or organization  
- **Extract components** (prompts, flows, documentation)  
- **Use it as a baseline** for your own system design  
- **Audit it** to understand assumptions and tradeoffs  

No permission required.
