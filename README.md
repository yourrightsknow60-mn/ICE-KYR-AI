# ICE Encounters Safety — Open Reference Repository

This repository is a transparent, open-source reference that organizations can inspect, copy, and adapt to build their own immigration rights, safety, or rapid-response tools. It is designed for replication and auditing, not ownership—showing *how* the system works so others can responsibly create their own versions.

---

## Purpose

This repo exists to make **process, structure, and safeguards visible**.

Rather than shipping a closed product, it documents:
- How safety-oriented, rights-focused systems can be designed
- How information is constrained, framed, and delivered responsibly
- How to reduce harm, misinformation, and escalation during high-risk situations

Everything here is meant to be forked, adapted, or used as a reference.

## Repository Structure

  Files in this folder are intended to be uploaded directly into the Gemini Gem’s Knowledge Base.  
  These include Know Your Rights materials, legal context, and supporting reference documents.

### Physical Tools
- **`/whistles/`**  
  Contains files related to 3D printing emergency whistles used for community alerting and rapid response.

### Setup & Replication
