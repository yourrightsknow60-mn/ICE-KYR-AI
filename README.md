# ICE-KYR-AI
This repository is a transparent, open-source reference that organizations can inspect, copy, and adapt to build their own immigration rights, safety, or rapid-response AI Agents. It is designed for replication and auditing, not ownership—showing how the system works so others can responsibly create their own versions.
